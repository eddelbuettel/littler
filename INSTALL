1. Installation from distributed sources
========================================

1.1 Requirements
----------------

    GNU R has to be installed in a shared-library configuration. This
    not the default, so you may have to rebuild R.  If in doubt, look
    for a file 'libR.so' which should be in the lib/ directory of your
    R installtions, i.e. in

	/usr/local/lib/R/libR.so

    or

	/usr/lib/R/libR.so

    If R is not compiled with a shared library, you need to rebuild
    and reinstall R.  See the R manuals for details.

    Linux and OS X are known to be supported at this point.
    
    In all likelihood, the requirement of shared libary precludes
    installation of littler on Windoze.


1.2 Basic Steps
---------------

   The minimal recipe for installation should apply, i.e. start by

 	$ ./configure

   which will find the first path to R in your environment variable PATH. 
   
   If you want the binary to be installation with a name other than 'r' 
   (which is a good idea on case-insensitive systems like OS X), then you 
   can set either --program-suffix or --program-prefix as in

      ./configure --program-suffix=sp			# creates rsp

   and 

      ./configure --program-prefix=little		# creates littler

   If there's another R installation you want to use, then you'll have to 
   readjust the PATH. For example:

		$ PATH=~/R-trunk/bin:$PATH ./configure

   Then

	$ make

   should build the 'r' binary, and 

	$ sudo make install

   should install it, as well as the manual page.


2. Installation from SVN
========================


2.1 Requirements
----------------

    As above, but you will also need autoconf, aclocal, and of course
    svn itself.


2.2 SVN checkout
----------------

    Anonymous checkout is available via 

	$ svn checkout http://littler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ littler


2.3 Build preparation
---------------------

    You can simply run the catch-all script 'bootstrap':

	$ bootstrap

    which includes the steps from 1.2 above and produces a new
    executable.

    If you want to set configure options, you can do so too after an
    initial 'bootstrap' call.



3. Binary Installation
======================

3.1 Debian
----------

    Calling

	$ sudo apt-get install littler

    is all it takes if your sources.list file points to testing or
    unstable.
