Title: R at the Command-Line via 'r'
Version: 0.3.12

Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel and Jeff Horner
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: A scripting and command-line front-end
 is provided by 'r' (aka 'littler') as a lightweight binary wrapper around
 the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
 While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
 both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hash-mark-exclamation-path
 expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
 standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without
 the environment.
