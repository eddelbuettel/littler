Note that BSPM support is still somewhat experimental. It also requires support
(via the 'bspm' package) of the underlying system package manager, which is known to
work for apt/dpkg (Debian, Ubuntu, ...) and dnf/yum (Fedora/RH/CentOS). Please file
issue tickets at the Github repo for littler (or bspm) if you can help with additional
settings.

Note that to take fullest advantage of BSPM, you also need the system package manager to
know about the largest number of pre-compiled packages. For Ubuntu, this means the
exanded 'ppa:c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+' repo, and for Fedora the say 'iucar/cran' Copr archive.
